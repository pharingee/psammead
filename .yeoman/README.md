# Yeoman: Psammead Package Generator

## Purpose

We are expecting the Psammead component library to expand in size. To ensure a uniform development pattern is used for creating new pacakges, this script will create a skeleton package that includes all the essential files for a developer to start making Psammead components.

## How to use it?

Run `npm run create:package`.

CLI will prompt user to enter their desired pacakge name, description of package and author details.

## Example of script being used:
