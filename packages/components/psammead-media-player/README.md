## Description
The `psammead-media-player` component exports two versions of our media player: an AMP version, and an Canonical version.

At it's core, this component returns an `iframe` that is designed to frame a media asset. 
The AMP variant will render an `amp-iframe` with a nested `amp-img` to use as a placeholder.
The Canonical variant will render a placeholder, that when clicked will load the `iframe` into view.

## When to use this component
This component to be used at any point on the page, specifically when a media player is needed.

## Installation
`npm install @bbc/psammead-media-player`

## Props
### CanonicalMediaPlayer

| Argument  | Type                | Required | Default | Example         |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `src` | string | Yes   | - | `http://foobar.com/embeddable_endpoint` |
| `showPlaceholder` | boolean | No   | `true` | `false` |
| `placeholderSrc` | string | No   | `null` | `http://foobar.com/placeholder.png` |
| `portrait` | boolean | No   | `false` | `true` |

The `src` prop is required, as it tells the component what page it needs to embed.
The `portrait` prop is not required, and defaults to `false`. This is to support portrait video content in the future.
The `showPlaceholder` boolean prop is also not required, and defaults to `true`.
Assuming `showPlaceholder` is `true`, the `placeholderSrc` will be what image to display as the placeholder.

### AmpMediaPlayer

| Argument  | Type                | Required | Default | Example         |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `src` | string | Yes   | - | `http://foobar.com/embeddable_endpoint` |
| `portrait` | boolean | No   | `false` | `true` |
| `placeholderSrc` | string | yes   | - | `http://foobar.com/placeholder.png` |

The `placeholderSrc` prop is required for AMP, as in order to have the component load an `amp-iframe` within 600px or 75% of the viewport from the top, we must have an `amp-img` placeholder. For more information on this, please refer to the [AMP docs for amp-iframe](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-iframe/).

## Usage
### CanonicalMediaPlayer
```js
import { CanonicalMediaPlayer } from '@bbc/psammead-media-player';

const Container = ({ src, portrait, showPlaceholder, placeholderSrc }) => (
  <CanonicalMediaPlayer
    src={src}
    portrait={portrait}
    placeholderSrc={placeholderSrc}
    showPlaceholder={showPlaceholder}
  />
)
```

### AmpMediaPlayer
```js
import { AmpMediaPlayer } from '@bbc/psammead-media-player';

const Container = ({ src, portrait, placeholderSrc }) => (
  <AmpMediaPlayer
    src={src}
    portrait={portrait}
    placeholderSrc={placeholderSrc}
  />
)
```
