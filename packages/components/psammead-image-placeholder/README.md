## Description

The `psammead-image-placeholder` component is a `div` with a base-64 encoded SVG background image that depicts the BBC logo. The component accepts a ratio as a prop. In the Psammead component library, Image Placeholder is used within the [psammead-figure](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/tree/latest/packages/components/psammead-figure) component.

## Installation

`npm install @bbc/psammead-image-placeholder`

## Props

| Argument | Type                                   | Required | Default | Example |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Ratio    | Number, ratio between height and width | Yes      | N/A     | 65.625  |

## Usage

The ImagePlaceholder component is expected to contain an image as a child element.

```jsx
import ImagePlaceholder from '@bbc/psammead-image-placeholder';

const WrapperComponent = ({
  ratio,
}) => (
  <ImagePlaceholder ratio={ratio}>
    <img src="http://some-image.url">
  </ImagePlaceholder>
);
```

### When to use this component

Psammead Image Placeholder is designed to appear as a temporary stand-in to be replaced by an actual image, for example in the case of lazy loading.

<!-- ### When not to use this component -->

### Accessibility notes

As a `div` with a background image, Psammead Image Placeholder is a presentational element without semantic meaning. As such it does not need to meet colour contrast requirements.
